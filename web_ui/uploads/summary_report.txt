2. Differentiation protocols should include parallel neural and mesodermal differentiation using distinct methods to enhance experimental design integrity (Reviews 4 & 5).
3. Co-expression verification of T-GFP positive cells with Sox2 at plating is essential to establish initial cell conditions (Reviews 4 & 5).
4. The negative control in Fig3B requires improvement to ensure experimental accuracy (Reviews 4 & 5).
5. Investigating the influence of clone size on lineage identity is necessary to understand variations in cell type expression (Reviews 4 & 5).
6. Additional marker analysis to confirm T(Bra)/Sox2 double negative colonies in figure 3D and E is recommended (Reviews 4 & 5).

ACTION CHECKLIST:
1. Provide a rationale and discussion on the usage of ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 in the methodology.
2. Consider conducting parallel differentiation experiments with distinct protocols for neural and mesodermal lineages.

[20] Assessing the bipotency of in vitro-derived neuromesodermal progenitors
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Manuscript ID: NMP_Bipotency_2023
Reviews Synthesized: 1

CONSENSUS:
The review of the manuscript highlights a need for clearer methodology and stronger evidence to support findings. Major concerns involve the use of specific protocols and clarity on expression markers. There are also smaller issues related to data presentation and minor clarifications.

MAJOR ISSUES:
1. Clarification on the use of ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 is needed. ("The authors should comment on the use of the ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 in their protocol for cell sorting and during subsequent plating at low density.")
2. Reasons for not performing parallel neural and mesodermal differentiation protocols should be explained. ("Why did the authors not perform neural and mesodermal differentiation in parallel using two distinct protocols?")
3. Evidence that T-GFP positive cells are Sox2 co-expressing at plating should be provided, possibly using immuno-cytochemistry. ("It would be reassuring here if the authors had demonstrated that sorted individual T-GFP +ve cells were also Sox2 co-expressing at the time of plating – even if this required immuno-cytochemistry.")
4. Inclusion of T(Bra)-GFP undifferentiated EpiSCs as a negative control is recommended. ("A good negative control would be to analyse T(Bra)-GFP undifferentiated EpiSCs as they will have the same genetic background as the NMPs analyzed later but won’t express T(Bra).")
5. Investigate T(Bra)/Sox2 double negative colonies using other neural and mesodermal markers like Pax6 or Sox1 and Paraxis. ("The authors should address this by looking at other neural and mesodermal markers, such as Pax6 or Sox1 and Paraxis.")

ACTION CHECKLIST:
1. Provide a detailed explanation of the use of ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 in the methodology section.
2. Include rationale for not doing parallel differentiation protocols in the discussion.
3. Add immuno-cytochemistry data showing T-GFP positive cells are also Sox2 co-expressing at plating.
4. Include a negative control using T(Bra)-GFP undifferentiated EpiSCs.
5. Test T(Bra)/Sox2 double negative colonies with additional markers like Pax6, Sox1, and Paraxis.
6. Analyze cell lineage identity considering clone size in the results section.
7. Comment on coexpression rate discrepancies found with FGF2/CHIR protocol.
8. Correct texts errors in Figure legends.

[21] A fixed-dose randomized controlled trial of olanzapine for psychosis in Parkinson disease
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Manuscript ID: A fixed-dose randomized controlled trial of olanzapine for psychosis in Parkinson disease
Reviews Synthesized: Not found

CONSENSUS:
The manuscript under review tests olanzapine for treating psychosis in Parkinson's Disease (PD). While the study provides insight into the potential motor side effects of olanzapine, there are substantial concerns regarding its methodology, interpretation of results, and efficacy claims, which suggest the study's conclusions might be limited or skewed.

MAJOR ISSUES:
- Methodological Concerns: The study's allowance for changes in dopaminergic medication introduces potential confounding factors that could skew results. (Review 2, 3, 8, 9)
- Interpretation Flaws: There is an incorrect assumption that olanzapine's receptor profile is similar to clozapine, which is contested in recent references. The manuscript suggests that delusions precede hallucinations, which reviewers disagree with. (Review 2, 3, 9, 14)
- Study Design Issues: Unplanned changes, including dosage adjustments after study initiation, led to the exclusion of subjects and affected the study's validity and power due to high dropout rates. (Review 8, 9)

ACTION CHECKLIST:
- Reassess and articulate the allowance for dopaminergic dose adjustments in the method section, addressing the potential impact on study results.
- Provide updated references on the comparative receptor profiles of antipsychotic drugs and clarify interpretations based on these sources.
- Clearly articulate the limitations imposed by unplanned changes and high dropout rates on study conclusions and efficacy claims.
- Correctly place the square brackets information in citations to ensure consistency.
- Explain the context and implications of 'Type II error' more clearly in the discussion.

CONSENSUS:
The manuscript provides an insightful analysis of the bipotency of in vitro-derived neuromesodermal progenitors, though several issues related to data consistency and methodological clarity have been highlighted. Addressing these issues will significantly strengthen the findings and conclusions presented.

MAJOR ISSUES:
1. Data Inconsistency: There is a discrepancy in the data regarding the number of cells in T+ clones, as shown in Fig 3D compared to Fig 3C. It raises questions about whether all subsets of clones were consistently scored. 
2. Image Quality: The resolution issues in Figures 1 and 2 make it hard to discern T-GFP and Sox2 co-expression in individual cells.
3. Inconsistent Color Schemes: Fluorescence images use varying color schemes across figures, confusing the interpretation of results. 
4. Methodological Concerns: Potential confounding in fluorescence imaging due to GFP background, especially concerning Sox2 and Tbx6 marker detection. 
5. Data Mismatch: A highlighted clone in the bottom panel of Fig 3C lacks expected T+/Sox2+ cells, inconsistent with the figure legends.
6. Methodology Clarification: Differences between clonal types at various sorting stages need elucidation, specifically regarding "Sorted at D2-IF at D4" versus "Sorted at D3-IF at Day 5 FGF2/CHIR".

ACTION CHECKLIST:
1. Ensure consistency in the data presented between figures, particularly regarding T+ clone cell numbers.
2. Improve image resolution in Figures 1 and 2 for clearer marker expression interpretation.
3. Standardize color schemes across all figures for fluorescence imagery.
4. Address potential confounding in fluorescent imaging methods concerning Sox2 and Tbx6.
