While clozapine is an effective treatment, the need for blood monitoring has limited its first-line use.Objective:Since olanzapine shows similar receptor affinity to clozapine, we hypothesized that it might be an effective alternative to clozapine for treatment of drug-induced psychosis (DIP) in PD, and that lower doses than usual might make it tolerable.Methods:In 1998-2003 we conducted a four-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group, fixed-dose trial of olanzapine (0, 2.5mg, or 5mg) in 23 PD patients with DIP while allowing for clinically realistic dose adjustments of dopaminomimetic mid-study. The primary outcome measures were Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) ratings scored from videotaped interviews after study termination by an observer blinded to dose assignment and to interview timing, and CGI (Clinical Global Impression). The Unified Parkinson\u2019s Disease Rating Scale motor subscale (UPDRS) was the primary measure of tolerability.Results:Intention-to-treat analysis found no significant differences among treatment groups in study completion or serious adverse events. However, a disproportionate number of olanzapine vs. placebo subjects reported mild side effects (p<0.04), many citing motor worsening.

Although the data was collected a decade ago, the information is still relevant because remarkably little progress has been made since 2003 in the treatment of PD related psychosis. Dr. Richard\u2019s referee response presents the methodological shortcomings and correctly points out resulting limitations in data interpretation. I agree with all of the comments in her review.\nIn addition, I would like to add the following comments/observations:\nIn the abstract and introduction, the authors suggest that because olanzapine has a similar receptor binding profile to clozapine, it is a good candidate drug to study in the PD population and they cite\nSeeman\net al.\n1993\n. More recent work by Seeman shows that what is unique about clozapine is that it binds D2 receptors \u201cloosely\u201d and that its receptor occupancy is short-lived. Quetiapine has a similar D2 binding profile to clozapine but, olanzapine behaves much more like haloperidol and risperidone in this regard. This may explain the motor worsening that seems to be associated with olanzapine use in PD. (\nKapur and Seeman. Am J Psychiatry 2001;158:360-369\n.\nSeeman and Tallerico. Am J Psychiatry 1999;156:876-884\n.)\nI disagree with the statement in the introduction that \u201c\nDelusions, when they occur, often antedate visual hallucinations...\n.\u201d The natural history of hallucinations in PD has been looked at in only a few longitudinal studies and the interaction between hallucination and delusions has not been adequately studied but my clinical experience and the bulk of what is presented in the literature suggests that minor hallucinatory phenomena (illusions, passage or presence hallucinations, benign hallucinations with insight) are much more common and occur earlier in PD than delusions. Delusions are generally associated with more severe underlying cognitive impairment, by definition are associated with lost insight and are generally considered to indicate a more advanced stage of disease progression than isolated visual hallucinations. (\nFenelon\net al.\nBrain 2000;123:733-745\n).\nI would also question the premise that allowing for a dopaminergic medication dose adjustment in the study protocol (to reverse any worsening of PD motor symptoms due to the introduction of low dose olanzapine) might produce study results that are a more appropriate way to evaluate how this drug might work in the clinic. My experience is that this strategy is unsustainable even in the short term in this population. One reason is that each dose increase of dopaminergic medication is prone to reignite symptoms of psychosis and thus lead to a need for higher doses of the antipsychotic, setting up a cycle of overall worsening. Secondly, these patients tend to have more advanced motor symptoms including high risk symptoms such as postural instability and dysphagia. It may be very difficult to continue a drug known to worsen PD motor symptoms after the first fall or choking episode even if one cannot be sure it was a direct result of the antipsychotic drug.\nI would suggest more clearly pointing out that this study cohort had relatively mild cognitive impairment (MMSE >26) which may be quite different than what is encountered in practice. More demented patients may be more susceptible to side effects of atypical neuroleptics including sedation, encephalopathy and motor worsening. More demented patients may also have more severe psychosis which is likely to be less responsive to the low doses used in this and some other clinical trials.\nFinally, I suspect that some readers may not have a full grasp of \u201cType II error\u201d. This should probably be spelled out without jargon in the discussion.\nCompeting Interests:\nNo competing interests were disclosed.\nI confirm that I have read this submission and believe that I have an appropriate level of expertise to confirm that it is of an acceptable scientific standard.\nClose\nREAD LESS\nCITE\nCITE\nHOW TO CITE THIS REPORT\nMolho E.

Nevertheless the rationale described explains the original protocol design, and as he points out, we need more controlled data to definitively answer this and other questions about treatment.\nI agree that the mild cognitive impairment in this sample limits the application of the results to a total clinical population of psychosis in PD. However, it can also be seen as a strength of the study, in that psychosis with dementia may conceivably differ in etiology and optimal treatment, so in that respect this sample may be considered more \"pure.\"\nView more\nView less\nCompeting Interests\nI'm the corresponding author.\nreply\nRespond\nReport a concern",

    "manuscript_abstract": "Background:Psychosis is a common and debilitating side effect of long-term dopaminergic treatment of Parkinson disease (PD). While clozapine is an effective treatment, the need for blood monitoring has limited its first-line use.Objective:Since olanzapine shows similar receptor affinity to clozapine, we hypothesized that it might be an effective alternative to clozapine for treatment of drug-induced psychosis (DIP) in PD, and that lower doses than usual might make it tolerable.Methods:In 1998-2003 we conducted a four-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group, fixed-dose trial of olanzapine (0, 2.5mg, or 5mg) in 23 PD patients with DIP while allowing for clinically realistic dose adjustments of dopaminomimetic mid-study. The primary outcome measures were Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) ratings scored from videotaped interviews after study termination by an observer blinded to dose assignment and to interview timing, and CGI (Clinical Global Impression). The Unified Parkinson\u2019s Disease Rating Scale motor subscale (UPDRS) was the primary measure of tolerability.Results:Intention-to-treat analysis found no significant differences among treatment groups in study completion or serious adverse events. However, a disproportionate number of olanzapine vs. placebo subjects reported mild side effects (p<0.04), many citing motor worsening. Fourteen patients completed the study (seven on placebo, two on 2.5mg olanzapine, five on 5mg olanzapine).

These neuromesodermal progenitors (NMPs) are the source of new axial structures during embryonic rostrocaudal axis elongation and are marked by the simultaneous co-expression of the transcription factors T(Brachyury) (T(Bra)) and Sox2. NMP-like cells have recently been derived from pluripotent stem cellsin vitrofollowing combined stimulation of Wnt and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling. Under these conditions the majority of cultures consist of T(Bra)/Sox2 co-expressing cells after 48-72 hours of differentiation. Although the capacity of these cells to generate posterior neural and paraxial mesoderm derivatives has been demonstrated at the population level, it is unknown whether a singlein vitro-derived NMP can give rise to both neural and mesodermal cells. Here we demonstrate that T(Bra) positive cells obtained from mouse epiblast stem cells (EpiSCs) after culture in NMP-inducing conditions can generate both neural and mesodermal clones. This finding suggests that, similar to their embryonic counterparts,in vitro-derived NMPs are truly bipotent and can thus be exploited as a model for studying the molecular basis of developmental cell fate decisions.READ ALLREAD LESS",

Using T(Bra)-GFP expressing EpiSCs, the authors performed a clonal analysis of NMP differentiation driven by a FGF2/CHIR regime. They show that single T(Bra)-GFP expressing cells can generate both mesodermal T(Bra)-GFP and neural Sox2 expressing cells in the same clone. This main finding demonstrates the neuromesodermal bipotency of in vitro derived NMP at the single cell level, recapitulating the behaviour of NMPs as identified by retrospective clonal analysis in the mouse embryo in Tzouanacou\net al.\n2009.\nOverall, the experiments presented are well designed and the results are carefully analyzed. However, the paper would benefit from improvement of specific points.\nMain comments:\nMethods\nThe authors should comment on the use of the ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 in their protocol for cell sorting and during subsequent plating at low density.\nExperimental approaches\nFigure 2 describes the co-appearance of distinct T(Bra)\n+\nand Sox2\n+\ncells from an NMP population treated by FGF2/CHIR as a way to induce simultaneously neural and mesodermal lineages. Why did the authors not perform neural and mesodermal differentiation in parallel using two distinct protocols?\nIn this study, we are dependent on the previous finding that cells plated at low density give rise mainly (95%) to monoclonal colonies in the time frame of the experiment. It would be reassuring here if the authors had demonstrated that sorted individual T-GFP +ve cells were also Sox2 co-expressing at the time of plating \u2013 even if this required immuno-cytochemistry, it would at least establish the proportion of bra/sox2 co-expressing cells in the starting conditions.\nDoes the negative control in Fig3B represent WT EpiSCs treated with the FGF2/CHIR regime, or are they just undifferentiated cells? A good negative control would be to analyse T(Bra)-GFP undifferentiated EpiSCs as they will have the same genetic background as the NMPs analyzed later but won\u2019t express T(Bra). This control should be included as well.\nFigure 3C shows clones of various sizes in terms of cell number. Can the size of the clone have an impact on cell lineage identity? It would be good to standardize the analysis by looking at the different expression patterns in colonies with comparable cell numbers.\nFigure 3D and E, the authors comment on the appearance of T(Bra)/Sox2 double negative colonies, and suggest that they are likely to represent further differentiated derivatives. The authors should address this by looking at other neural and mesodermal markers, such as Pax6 or Sox1 and Paraxis. It would be very informative to know what those cells become. Indeed, the suggestion that a higher density of cells is needed for paraxial mesoderm differentiation might indicate that those negative clones are not mesodermal derivatives.\nMinor comments:\nIn figure 1, the authors describe the establishment of an NMP population. Using a FGF2/CHIR differentiation protocol, they only obtain around 38% of T(Bra)-GFP/Sox2 coexpression, with maximum 60% of T(Bra)+ cells in the whole population. However, other studies show up to 80% of coexpression in the same conditions. The authors should comment on that.\nFigure 2B: the figure legend should indicate \u201call nuclei\u201d instead of \u201cell nuclei\u201d.\nThe legend for figure 3 (D-E) is confusing and should be clarified.\nCompeting Interests:\nNo competing interests were disclosed.\nWe confirm that we have read this submission and believe that we have an appropriate level of expertise to confirm that it is of an acceptable scientific standard, however we have significant reservations, as outlined above.\nClose\nREAD LESS\nCITE\nCITE\nHOW TO CITE THIS REPORT\nStorey KG and Verrier L.

By fluorescence activated cell sorting applied to these EpiSCs cultured in NMP-promoting conditions, they could purify the T Bra positive NMPs and analyze their clonal descendants.

    "review_text": "Author Response\n31 Jul 2015\nAnestis Tsakiridis,\nMRC Centre for Regenerative Medicine, Institute for Stem Cell Research, School of Biological Sciences, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, EH16 4UU, UK\nWe would like to thank all three reviewers both for their positive comments and constructive suggestions which improved significantly the quality of our manuscript. Our responses below are shown in italics while reviewer comments are in bold.\nMain comments:\nMethods\nThe authors should comment on the use of the ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 in their protocol for cell sorting and during subsequent plating at low density.\nThe ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 is a well-established reagent in human embryonic (hES) and epiblast stem cell (EpiSC) culture used to enhance survival of single cells (\nWatanabe et al., 2007\n) and thus we routinely employ it in FACS sorting experiments as a means of counteracting dissociation-induced apoptosis.\nExperimental approaches\nFigure 2 describes the co-appearance of distinct T(Bra)\n+\nand Sox2\n+\ncells from an NMP population treated by FGF2/CHIR as a way to induce simultaneously neural and mesodermal lineages. Why did the authors not perform neural and mesodermal differentiation in parallel using two distinct protocols?\nClonal analysis is required because pluripotent stem cell differentiation is never 100% efficient at the population level. We thus aimed to assess the ability of single NMP cells to generate both neural and mesodermal derivatives at the same time using conditions promoting the simultaneous emergence of both lineages (i.e. FGF/CHIR treatment).\nIn this study, we are dependent on the previous finding that cells plated at low density give rise mainly (95%) to monoclonal colonies in the time frame of the experiment. It would be reassuring here if the authors had demonstrated that sorted individual T-GFP +ve cells were also Sox2 co-expressing at the time of plating \u2013 even if this required immuno-cytochemistry, it would at least establish the proportion of bra/sox2 co-expressing cells in the starting conditions.\nWe agree that ideally the extent of T(Bra)/Sox2 co-expression should be assessed at the time of low density plating. However, in our opinion, its determination can only be achieved using a T/Sox2 double reporter cell line. The alternative option suggested by the reviewers involving the use of immunocytochemistry would be technically challenging given that freshly sorted and plated TGFP+ cells require a few hours to attach properly thus precluding antibody staining at the very start of the experiment.\nDoes the negative control in Fig3B represent WT EpiSCs treated with the FGF2/CHIR regime, or are they just undifferentiated cells? A good negative control would be to analyse T(Bra)-GFP undifferentiated EpiSCs as they will have the same genetic background as the NMPs analyzed later but won\u2019t express T(Bra). This control should be included as well.\nThe control used in Fig. 3B was indeed differentiated E14tg2a EpiSCs. This is the same genetic background as the TGFP+ ES cells (E14.1, 129/Ola;\nFehling et al., 2003\n) we used to derive the EpiSC line employed in this study. It is not possible to utilize undifferentiated TGFP EpiSCs as a negative control for FACS as they also express significant levels of both T(BRA) protein and the TGFP reporter under self-renewing conditions (i.e. in FGF2 and Activin A) in line with previous reports (\nTsakiridis et al., 2014\n;\nKurek et al., 2015\n).\nFigure 3C shows clones of various sizes in terms of cell number. Can the size of the clone have an impact on cell lineage identity? It would be good to standardize the analysis by looking at the different expression patterns in colonies with comparable cell numbers.\nSplitting the data in Fig. 3C-D based on clone size would be a good way to decipher a link between colony cell number and lineage identity acquisition, a possibility which is indeed very interesting.\nHowever, this type of representation would be more suitable for a larger dataset. Our clone numbers are too small to support any solid conclusions on this issue and we believe that the representation we opted for is the best way to illustrate graphically both parameters (i.e. clone size and lineage composition). We will be happy to incorporate any specific suggestions and or/consider alternative ways of depicting the results.\nFigure 3D and E, the authors comment on the appearance of T(Bra)/Sox2 double negative colonies, and suggest that they are likely to represent further differentiated derivatives. The authors should address this by looking at other neural and mesodermal markers, such as Pax6 or Sox1 and Paraxis. It would be very informative to know what those cells become. Indeed, the suggestion that a higher density of cells is needed for paraxial mesoderm differentiation might indicate that those negative clones are not mesodermal derivatives.\nThis is a good point which deserves further investigation. Our preliminary data indicate that T(Bra)\n-\nSox2\n-\ncolonies are also negative for Sox1. However, a thorough analysis of these clones will require significant effort and is beyond the scope of this short research note. We have added a sentence in the last paragraph of the results section raising the possibility that double negative clones may also comprise differentiated derivatives of single sorted TGFP\n+\nSox2\n-\ncells which are probably precursors of mesodermal cell types other than paraxial, also emerging upon culture in FGF2/CHIR.\nMinor comments:\nIn figure 1, the authors describe the establishment of an NMP population. Using a FGF2/CHIR differentiation protocol, they only obtain around 38% of T(Bra)-GFP/Sox2 coexpression, with maximum 60% of T(Bra)+ cells in the whole population. However, other studies show up to 80% of coexpression in the same conditions. The authors should comment on that.\nLine-to-line variation in terms of differentiation potential is a common phenomenon in pluripotent stem cell cultures (e.g. see\nOsafune et al., 2008\n) and in our hands we also observe some variation between different EpiSC lines both in terms of the extent of induction of NMP-like cells upon culture in FGF2/CHIR as well as the timing of their emergence. The lower numbers of T(Bra)\n+\nSox2\n+\ndouble positive cells we observed in this study when compared to the high efficiency of induction exhibited by the in vivo derived EpiSC line R04-GFP (\nGouti et al., 2014\n) is an example of such variation. One interesting possibility is raised by the fact that the T(Bra) reporter line we employ here contains a GFP cassette knocked into the first exon of the T(Bra) gene (\nFehliing et al., 2003\n). The resulting heterozygosity may lead to lower efficiency of T(Bra)\n+\nSox2\n+\ncell generation.\nFigure 2B: the figure legend should indicate \u201call nuclei\u201d instead of \u201cell nuclei\u201d.\nWe cannot locate the phrase the reviewers are referring to. The exact figure legend wording in Fig. 2B is \u201cIn all cases cell nuclei were visualized using DAPI\u201d.\nThe legend for figure 3 (D-E) is confusing and should be clarified.\nWe have addressed this point in the new version.\nView more\nView less\nCompeting Interests\nNo competing interests were disclosed.\nreply\nRespond\nReport a concern",

    "review_text": "Author Response\n31 Jul 2015\nAnestis Tsakiridis,\nMRC Centre for Regenerative Medicine, Institute for Stem Cell Research, School of Biological Sciences, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, EH16 4UU, UK\nOur responses below are shown in italics while reviewer comments are in bold.\nIssues to be clarified:\nInconsistency of experimental data\nData shown in Fig 3D indicates that T+ clones contain 2 and 4 cells (the majority) with a few having up to 6 cells.\u00a0 The example of T+ve clone shown in Fig 3C contains at least 9 cells. This result is not included the dataset of Fig 3D (Day 2 sorted) or E (Day 3 sorted). Were all or only subsets of clones scored for these clonal culture experiments?\nWe wish to thank the reviewers for spotting the mistake. All clone examples shown in Fig. 3C are taken from the culture experiments described in this study and are included in the scoring graphs in Fig. 3D-E. The T(Bra)+Sox2- clone the reviewers are referring to was mistakenly shown in Fig. 3E as consisting of 7 instead of 9 cells. We have rectified the mistake in the new version (3rd clone from the left, depicted in green). We also re-examined all data and found two further errors:\n(1) a T(Bra)+Sox2+ double positive clone (also shown as an example in Fig. 3C, top row) was accidentally omitted from the top graph in Fig. 3D\n(2)a 3-cell clone in the same graph was wrongly depicted as containing two Sox2+ cells and a double negative instead of two Sox2+ cells and a T(Bra)+ cell.\nThese changes have now been incorporated into the new figure version and the data is now correct to the best of our knowledge. We would like to apologise for these errors.\nQuality of the image data\na. It is difficult to discern the co-expression, or otherwise, of T-GFP and Sox2 in individual cells at the resolution of Fig 1 and 2.\nWe have now included higher magnification images in figures 1 and 2 to address this issue.\nb. It appears that cells with mixed gene expression are only found in some colonies (Fig 1), rather than in a salt and pepper manner in every colony. This may require an explanation in the context of clonal development.\nThis is an intriguing observation supporting the idea that NMPs segregate separately from other mesodermal/neural precursors emerging simultaneously in culture conditions promoting a late primitive streak-like environment. It is likely to reflect the fact that the starting EpiSC population is heterogeneous in self-renewing conditions, consisting of cells with differential capacity to generate separate distinct lineages. For example we have previously reported that T(Bra)+Sox2+ and T(Bra)+Foxa2+ mesodermal precursors emerge in a mutually exclusive manner after Wnt signaling stimulation of EpiSCs (\nTsakiridis et al., 2014\n). It may also be true that the generation of NMP-like, T(Bra)+Sox2+ cells is non-synchronous. We have added a sentence in the first paragraph of the results section to comment on this.\nc. It can be confusing when different colour schemes were used to show the fluorescence results, e.g. T-GFP signals are shown variously in green (Fig 1), white (Fig 2B) and red (Fig 3C), and Sox2 is shown in red (Fig 1) and green (Fig 2B, 3C), rather than red (which is for Tbx6, Fig 2B). Given that the FGF2/CHIR treated cells were sorted based on GFP activity, T-GFP signal should consistently be displayed- in green for all figures.\nWe have adopted the reviewers\u2019 recommendation and in the new figure versions T(Bra) expression appears in green while Sox2 is depicted in the red.\nAdditional data / information may help:\na. While it is plausible that the Tbx6+ cells might be descendents of the mesoderm progenitor, the results do not unequivocally show that they are derived from the T+ve cells.\nWe agree that the data presented here do not show directly that Tbx6+ cells are derived from T(Bra)+ cells. To indicate this we added the word \u201cpresumed\u201d before the sentence: \u201cmaturation of T(Bra)+ cells into Tbx6-positive paraxial mesoderm\u201d at the end of the Results section. However, we believe that our hypothesis is reasonable since it is based on published studies demonstrating that a considerable fraction of paraxial mesoderm arises from T(Bra)+ late primitive streak precursors (e.g.\nAnderson et al. 2013\n;\nCambray and Wilson, 2007\n).\nb. What is the evidence for that T-/Sox2- cells (which also did not expressing Tbx6) were \u201cmore differentiated\u201d NMP derivatives?\nWe are interested in characterizing further the T-/Sox2- clones (see also our response to Referees 1 above). We speculate that these are differentiated NMP-derivatives based on the observation that EpiSCs generating NMPs do not (as far as we can tell) lose Sox2 expression during that process and thus its subsequent loss is likely to indicate further differentiation to downstream NMP products. However, in the absence of any solid data on this point we decided to tone down our statements and expand our hypotheses:\n1) We modified our statement related to the double negative clones (last paragraph of results section) by replacing the phrase \u201care likely to represent\u201d with \u201cmay represent\u201d\n2) We raised the alternative possibility that these clones may arise from sorted single T(Bra)+ mesodermal precursors.\nc. Absence of Tbx6 cells in low density culture is an intriguing result.\u00a0 Is there any precedence that the differentiation of Tbx6-expressing cells is dependent on any \u201cparacrine\u201d signals?\nEmergence of Tbx6+ cells is likely to depend on FGF signaling (\nCiruna and Rossant, 2001\n)-we have now incorporated this possibility into the text together with the speculation that Notch-based regulation of Tbx6 transcription may also be critical for cell density effects (\nWhite et al., 2005\n).We have also shown previously that paracrine Wnt signaling promotes pioneer T(Bra)+ mesodermal precursors in EpiSCs cultured in self-renewal conditions (\nTsakiridis et al., 2014\n).\nd. Were the Sox2 and Tbx6 immunofluorescence signals captured in emission channel other than for green fluorescence? If not, would the IF results for these two markers be confounded by the T-GFP background?\nWe find this possibility unlikely especially since the Sox2+, Tbx6+ and TGFP+ expression domains shown in Fig. 2 were in most cases mutually exclusive from each other and very few or no double or triple positive cells (which could potentially represent a background artefact) were observed.\ne. Which are the examples of two types of mixed clones in the legend (\u201cT+ mixed with Sox2+\u201d and \u201cT+/Sox+ with T-/Sox2-\u201c) in the FGF2/CHIR and FGF experiments (Fig. 3D)?\nThe class of clones defined as \u201cT+ mixed with Sox2+\u201d refers to colonies containing T(Bra)+ single positive cells mixed with Sox2+ single positive cells (example shown in the 5th row in Fig. 3C) while the group defined as \u201cT+/Sox+ mixed with T-Sox2- \u201c describes clones containing T(Bra)+ OR Sox2+ single positive cells mixed with double negatives (example shown in bottom row in Fig. 3C). We would like to apologise for the lack of clarity. We tried to address this issue by making the legend of Fig. 3D-E more detailed.\nf. The bottom panel of Fig 3C: The \u201cT+/Sox2+ mixed with T-/Sox2-\u201d clone showed no T+/Sox2+ cells among the four cells in this figure.\nWe use the slash (\u201c/\u201d) to indicate \u201cOR\u201d (see our response directly above). Again we apologise for the confusion.\ng. Is there any difference in the clonal types between \u201cSorted at D2-IF at D4\u201d and \u201cSorted at D3-IF at Day 5 FGF2/CHIR\u201d groups? What is the rationale for testing the effect of an extended culture to Day 3 before sorting, and was there a parallel culture of \u201cFGF2 only\u201dto Day 3?\nWe observed a significant number of T(Bra)+Sox2+ cells both at 48 and 72 hrs of culture in FGF2/CHIR and thus we wished to examine whether these two populations are equivalent in their capacity to clonally generate both neural and mesodermal cells. Since the goal was to compare these two populations, we did not carry out an experiment involving a 3 day culture FGF2 prior to sorting and re-plating.\nView more\nView less\nCompeting Interests\nNo competing interests were disclosed.\nreply\nRespond\nReport a concern",

    "manuscript_abstract": "Retrospective clonal analysis in the mouse has demonstrated that the posterior spinal cord neurectoderm and paraxial mesoderm share a common bipotent progenitor. These neuromesodermal progenitors (NMPs) are the source of new axial structures during embryonic rostrocaudal axis elongation and are marked by the simultaneous co-expression of the transcription factors T(Brachyury) (T(Bra)) and Sox2. NMP-like cells have recently been derived from pluripotent stem cellsin vitrofollowing combined stimulation of Wnt and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling. Under these conditions the majority of cultures consist of T(Bra)/Sox2 co-expressing cells after 48-72 hours of differentiation. Although the capacity of these cells to generate posterior neural and paraxial mesoderm derivatives has been demonstrated at the population level, it is unknown whether a singlein vitro-derived NMP can give rise to both neural and mesodermal cells. Here we demonstrate that T(Bra) positive cells obtained from mouse epiblast stem cells (EpiSCs) after culture in NMP-inducing conditions can generate both neural and mesodermal clones. This finding suggests that, similar to their embryonic counterparts,in vitro-derived NMPs are truly bipotent and can thus be exploited as a model for studying the molecular basis of developmental cell fate decisions.READ ALLREAD LESS",
